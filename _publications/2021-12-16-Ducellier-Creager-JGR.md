title: "Depth and thickness of tectonic tremor in the northeastern Olympic Peninsula"
collection: publications
permalink: 
excerpt: 'In this paper, we use seismic data from small-aperture arrays in the Olympic Peninsula, and tremor epicenters determined by a previous study to compute the depth of the tremor from S minus P times determined from stacking horizontal-to-vertical cross-correlations of seismic data. The tremor is located close to the plate boundary in a region no more than 2-3 kilometers thick.'
