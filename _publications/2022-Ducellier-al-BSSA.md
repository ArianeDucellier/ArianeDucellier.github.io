title: "Detection of slow slip events using wavelet analysis of GNSS recordings"
collection: publications
permalink: 
excerpt: 'In this paper, we use a wavelet-based signal processing method to detect transients in GNSS data, such as slow slip events. In Northern Cascadia, there is good agreement between detections of slow slip using GNSS data and using tremor data. The method can be applied as a starting point to identify slow slip without prior information. New Zealand is shown as on example.'
