collection: publications

excerpt: 'In this paper, we establish an eight-year-long low-frequency earthquake catalog for southern Cascadia. Families from the subduction zone are mainly active during the big tremor episodes, with down dip families more active than up dip families. LFE activity is sensitive to tidal stress changes.'
