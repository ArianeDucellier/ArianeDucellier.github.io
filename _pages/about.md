I am interested in statistical forecasting, and more broadly data science using complex data across space and time. I am currently working on on forecasting housing market indicators at [Zillow](https://www.zillowgroup.com). 

Previously, I worked on low-frequency seismic data and numerical inversion of earthquake models at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) and the [the French Geological Survey (BRGM)](https://www.brgm.fr/en).
