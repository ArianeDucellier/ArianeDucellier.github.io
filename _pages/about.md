I am an Applied Scientist at Zillow. I am interested in statistical forecasting and spatio-temporal data more broadly.

I received my PhD degree in Earth and Space Sciences - Data Science and my MSc degree in Statistics from University of Washington. I hold a MSc degree in Applied Mathematics and Executive Engineering from CentraleSupelec which is now at University of Paris-Saclay.

I am passionate about modeling of planet Earth and time series analysis and forecasting. I have created and written a computer package implementing in Python the companion codes to Percival and Walden's wonderful book on wavelet-based time series analysis. The codes can potentially be used to model any time series data with short range and/or long dependence. I have designed and set up a demo of automatic detection of low-frequency seismic events.

During my PhD studies, I worked on slow earthquakes, subtle seismic features discovered recently, which duration ranges from a few days to several years and which recurrence delay ranges from months to years. I am using time series analysis and advanced signal processing to analyze large datasets of low-frequency seismic events that I have collected and processed. I have in particular discovered that long range temporal dependence characteristics can be observed in the Olympic Peninsula, Northern California, and Mexico catalogs.

From 2006 to 2015, I was a research scientist at BRGM (French Geological Survey), Franceâ€™s reference public institution for earth science applications in the management of surface and subsurface resources and risks. During the academic year 2015-2016, I was working with Jeroen Tromp and Frederik Simons in the Geosciences Department at Princeton University.
