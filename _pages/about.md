I am an Applied Scientist at [Zillow](https://www.zillowgroup.com). I am interested in statistical forecasting and spatio-temporal data more broadly.

I received my PhD degree in [Earth and Space Sciences](https://www.ess.washington.edu) - [Data Science](https://escience.washington.edu/education/phd/data-science-graduate-option/) and my MSc degree in [Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu) from [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu). I hold a MSc degree in Applied Mathematics and Executive Engineering from [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) which is now at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

I am passionate about modeling of planet Earth and time series analysis and forecasting. I have created and written a computer [package](https://github.com/ArianeDucellier/wmtsa) implementing in Python the companion codes to Percival and Walden's wonderful book on wavelet-based time series analysis. The codes can potentially be used to model any time series data with short range and/or long dependence. I have designed and set up a [demo](https://github.com/seismocodes/lfelib) of automatic detection of low-frequency seismic events.

During my PhD studies, I worked on slow earthquakes, subtle seismic features discovered recently, which duration ranges from a few days to several years and which recurrence delay ranges from months to years. I am using time series analysis and advanced signal processing to analyze large datasets of low-frequency seismic events that I have collected and processed. I have in particular discovered that long range temporal dependence characteristics can be observed in the Olympic Peninsula, Northern California, and Mexico catalogs.

From 2006 to 2015, I was a research scientist at [BRGM](https://www.brgm.fr/en) (French Geological Survey), France’s reference public institution for earth science applications in the management of surface and subsurface resources and risks. During the academic year 2015-2016, I was working with Jeroen Tromp and Frederik Simons in the [Geosciences](https://geosciences.princeton.edu) Department at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu).
