Wavelet analysis: Python tools to compute Discrete Wavelet Transform and other wavelet transforms. This repository contains scripts to carry out wavelet analyses as explained in:

Donald Percival and Andrew Walden. Wavelet Methods for Time Series Analysis. Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics

It also contains notebooks to reproduce some of the figures from the book:

    Chapter 4: Discrete Wavelet Transform

    Chapter 5: Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform

    Chapter 6: Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform

    Chapter 6: Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform

    Chapter 6: Best basis algorithm

Earthquake monitoring: Python tools to automatically analyze seismic data and update a catlog of low-frequency earthquakes.

Visualization: Python tools to visualize a catalog of tectonic tremor with Python library altair.
