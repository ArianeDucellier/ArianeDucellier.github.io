[Wavelet analysis](https://github.com/ArianeDucellier/wmtsa): Python tools to compute Discrete Wavelet Transform and other wavelet transforms. This repository contains scripts to carry out wavelet analyses as explained in:  

Donald Percival and Andrew Walden. Wavelet Methods for Time Series Analysis. Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics.  

It also contains notebooks to reproduce some of the figures from the book:
